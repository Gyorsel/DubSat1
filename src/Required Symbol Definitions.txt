The following symbols need to be defined for CCS projects (Properties on the project in Project Explorer, Build->MSP430 Compiler->Predefined Symbols) in order to select which board needs to be built, along with the supporting hardware (e.g. sensors like magnetometer):

  Board selection (ONE must be selected):
     __BSP_Board_MSP430FR5994LaunchPad__        :  The standard MSP430FR5994 LaunchPad board used for testing.
	 __BSP_Board_MSP430FR5994_CANMSPBlockv1__   :  New (as of 5/12/17) boards for testing custom boards.
	 
	 
  Other hardware selection (optional):
	Magnetometer choice:
	    __BSP_HW_MAGTOM_HMC5883L__   :  Honeywell HMC 5883L magnetometer (default if no magtom symbol defined)
		__BSP_HW_MAGTOM_MAG3110__    :  Freescale MAG3110
