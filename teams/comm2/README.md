# Subsystem Team Directory

This is the parent folder for all the named sub-team assets that need to be change-tracked or otherwise configuration-managed.  Be sure to use alternative storage options for large files that don't change over time (e.g. reference PDFs), or very large files even if they do.  The overall satellite repo needs to stay under approximately 1GB, as a reference.

Within those parameters, the owning team is free to organize and populate this directory (and whatever subdirectories needed) as they see fit.
